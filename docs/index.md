# What is TerminalDrawer?

TerminalDrawer is a simple program, that was made for fun, and intended to learn the C++ programming language. You may use it in your application(s) if you want to, although I don't see a use for it.

# How do I use it?

You'll have to build it yourself, see [this page](building.md)
